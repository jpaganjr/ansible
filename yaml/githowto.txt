GitLab Notes:

set basic config:

git config --global user.name jpaganjr23
git config --global user.email jesus@pdrtechgurus.comment

Add ssh key to online profile

Make a working directory:
i.e ---> mkdir -p ~/git/engineering/

cd ~/git/engineering 
clone the repo: git clone git@gitlab.ftlio.net:engineering/veritas

It will appear as a new directory then change to directory and cehck status:
cd veritas
git status


Making changes to the repo:

1. create a new local branch:
git checkout -b feature/add-ssh-key-jpagan ; the part after -b is the name of the branch, we have labels like feature, bugfix, deploy to describe the type of branch we're creating and then some short description after the slash
git status ; this will show you that you are on the correct branch, you should see: On branch feature/add-ssh-key-jpagan

2. Add, modify changes to files:
git add ; will add the files that you have made changes to you your LOCAL branch

3. Generate a merge_request

git push --- by default, you'll get something like:   git push --set-upstream origin feature/... 
             we'll take this and add something to the end to create the MR:
             git push --set-upstream origin feature/add-ssh-key-jpagan -o merge_request.create
             you'll get back some out that includes a numerical index for the MR, and we'll use that to create the commit message

4. Create the commit message:

git commit -m '!XXX - add Jesus' public key'; where XXX is the numerical index you got back from the merge_request.create
                                              make sure the commit message is in single-quotes due to using the ! in the comment

 * [new branch]        feature/add-ssh-key-jpagan -> feature/add-ssh-key-jpagan
Branch 'feature/add-ssh-key-jpagan' set up to track remote branch 'feature/add-ssh-key-jpagan' from 'origin'.

After the commit message, you can do: git push to upload the MR to gitlab
and then you can go to gitlab on your browser to check that your updated file made it to gitlab:
https://gitlab.ftlio.net/engineering/veritas/-/merge_requests/689

on that page, you'll need to edit the title and the description, here's an example of one someone did recently:
